Now here is a tailored `README.md` file for your **Data Integrity Checker** project:

# 🛡️ Data Integrity Checker

A Python-based application that tracks and verifies the integrity of files using blockchain principles. It stores file metadata and cryptographic hashes in a blockchain-like JSON structure to ensure tamper detection and traceability.

## 🚀 Features

* Tracks file hashes using a custom blockchain implementation
* Detects file tampering or changes using SHA-256
* Simple web interface using Flask (HTML template included)
* Stores hash chain in `blockchain.json` for audit and persistence

## 🧠 How It Works

Each file added to the system creates a **block** with:

* Filename
* Timestamp
* File hash (SHA-256)
* Previous block hash (like a real blockchain)

Any modification to a file breaks the chain, making tampering detectable.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **Python 3.11+**
* **Flask** (for the web interface)
* `hashlib`, `json`, `os`, `datetime` – for core functionality

## 🖥️ Running the Application

### 📦 Install Requirements

No external `requirements.txt` was included, but if using Flask:

```bash
pip install flask
```

### ▶️ Run the App

```bash
cd "data integrity checker"
python app.py
```

Then open a browser and go to:

```
http://localhost:5000
```

## 📂 Files

| File                   | Purpose                           |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| `app.py`               | Runs the Flask web server         |
| `block.py`             | Block structure and hashing logic |
| `storage.py`           | Handles read/write to blockchain  |
| `blockchain.json`      | Stores the blockchain (data)      |
| `templates/index.html` | Web interface                     |

## ✅ Use Cases

* Detect unauthorized file modifications
* Ensure file authenticity and consistency
* Educational tool to demonstrate blockchain principles

## 🧪 Sample Workflow

1. Upload or register a file via the interface.
2. The file’s hash and metadata are stored in a block.
3. On re-check, any hash mismatch indicates a tampering attempt.
